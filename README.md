  ðŸ’¬ Auto Comment/Like for Youtube Contests ðŸ’¬
</h3>

The YouTube channels that gained the most subscribers in the latest year show the platform's current trends
and the areas that are growing rapidly. YouTube channels like MrBeast and ZHC are known by giving away prizes
to the subscribers and for whatever reason, channels have sort of gamified the objective
of having the first comment/like on a video as soon as it releases!
Yeah, you know... here it comes the automation step! Using a Python command-line application that crawls the data out of YouTube
and search for the latest video of the specified YouTube channel with the goal to auto comment/like using
the YouTube API Provider.

### Install dependencies

- Only needs this step if you started without the use of Gitpod:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
- Use with your responsibility:
```
python ./src/youcheater.py
```
